# One-For-All
Simple command-based launcher for games from different launchers.

## Notes
This is a personal project and currently only detects games from the following libraries (might add more later on):
 - Steam
 - Epic Games

The only purpose of this is to launch games (i.e. you cannot install, unistall or add any other software).
