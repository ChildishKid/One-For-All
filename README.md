# One-For-All
Simple command-based launcher for games from different launchers.

## Notes
This is a personal project and currently only detects games from the following libraries (might add more later on):
 - Steam
 - Epic Games

The only purpose of this is to launch games (i.e. you cannot install, uninstall or add any other software).  
This also assumes that all games are installed under the same drive as launcher.
